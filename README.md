# MFWork
Build faster, ship safer.

**What is MFWork?**

MFWork is a framework, made for making apps much faster and more securely.
Currently it has only basic features, such as it's own configuration system, a file manager, and session validation.
The initial build (0.0.0, 17/08/25) is unstable. Please report any issues you run into while using the framework.

**Supported platforms**

The code for the framework as of now isn't exactly platform or CPU-architecture dependant..
still means you may run into issues. It is officially supported on a Linux machine that runs on x86_64.
